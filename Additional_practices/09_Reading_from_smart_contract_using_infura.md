To read from a smart contract deployed on a testnet using `ethers.js` and Infura, follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Infura and `ethers.js`**

1. **Create an Infura Project:**
   - Go to [Infura](https://infura.io/) and create an account if you don’t have one.
   - Create a new project and select the testnet you want to use (e.g., Ropsten, Goerli).

2. **Get the Infura URL:**
   - After creating the project, you’ll get a Project ID and Project Secret. Use these to construct the Infura URL.
   - Example URL format: `https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`

3. **Install `ethers.js`:**
   - If you haven’t already, install `ethers.js`:

     ```bash
     npm install ethers
     ```

### 2. **Write a Script to Read from the Smart Contract**

1. **Obtain Smart Contract Details:**
   - **Contract Address:** The address where your smart contract is deployed.
   - **ABI (Application Binary Interface):** The ABI of your smart contract defines the methods and events you can interact with.

2. **Create a Script:**
   - Create a file named `readContract.js`:

   ```javascript
   const { ethers } = require("ethers");

   // Infura URL (replace YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID with your actual Infura Project ID)
   const infuraUrl = "https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID";
   const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(infuraUrl);

   // Replace with your smart contract address
   const contractAddress = "0xYourContractAddress";

   // Replace with your smart contract ABI
   const contractABI = [
     "function getValue() view returns (uint256)", // Example function
     // Add other functions and events from your contract ABI here
   ];

   async function main() {
     // Create a contract instance
     const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider);

     // Call a contract function (example: `getValue`)
     try {
       const value = await contract.getValue();
       console.log(`Value from contract: ${value.toString()}`);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Error reading from contract:", error);
     }
   }

   main().catch(console.error);
   ```

   - **Replace `YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID`** with your actual Infura Project ID.
   - **Replace `0xYourContractAddress`** with the address of your deployed smart contract.
   - **Update the ABI** array with the ABI of your smart contract. The example ABI provided is just for illustration; make sure to use the actual ABI of your contract.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using Node.js:

     ```bash
     node readContract.js
     ```

   - This will connect to the Infura endpoint, interact with your smart contract on the specified testnet, and print the value returned from the `getValue` function.

### Summary

1. **Set up Infura** to get an endpoint URL for the testnet you’re working with.
2. **Install `ethers.js`** to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Write a script** to read from the smart contract using `ethers.js`, specifying the contract address and ABI.
4. **Run the script** to interact with the smart contract on the testnet.

By following these steps, you can read from your smart contract deployed on a testnet using `ethers.js` and Infura.
