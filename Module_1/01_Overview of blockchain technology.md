What is Blockchain?

- A decentralized, digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers
- A chain of blocks, each containing data, is created and linked together through cryptography

Key Features:

- Decentralized: No single entity controls the network
- Immutable: Transactions are tamper-proof and cannot be altered
- Transparent: All transactions are publicly visible
- Consensus: Network participants agree on the state of the blockchain

How it Works:

1. A network of nodes is established, each with a copy of the blockchain
2. When a new transaction is made, it is broadcast to the network
3. Nodes verify the transaction using complex algorithms
4. A group of nodes (miners) compete to solve a puzzle, validating the transaction
5. The winning miner adds the transaction to a new block and broadcasts it to the network
6. Nodes update their copy of the blockchain to include the new block

Types of Blockchains:

- Public (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum): Open to anyone, decentralized
- Private (e.g. enterprise blockchains): Restricted access, centralized control
- Consortium (e.g. Corda): Hybrid, controlled by a group of organizations

Use Cases:

- Cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ether)
- Smart Contracts (e.g. Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric)
- Supply Chain Management
- Identity Verification
- Healthcare Record Management

Benefits:

- Security: Immutable and tamper-proof
- Transparency: Publicly visible transactions
- Efficiency: Automated processes and reduced intermediaries
- Trust: Consensus mechanism ensures network agreement
