const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("MyContract", function () {
  it("Should return the correct value", async function () {
    const MyContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyContract");
    const myContract = await MyContract.deploy();
    await myContract.deployed();
    expect(await myContract.myFunction()).to.equal("expected value");
  });
});


This is just a basic example, but it demonstrates how you can use Hardhat's testing framework to write tests for your smart contracts.
